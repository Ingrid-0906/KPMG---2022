# Data Quality Assessment
### Overview

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. 
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more here). 
In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. 
The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of 
customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

    Customer Demographic 
    Customer Addresses
    Transactions data in the past 3 months


# The Task
Draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. Refer to ‘Data Quality Framework Table’ and resources below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

# Solution
To start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data taking as an example the Data Quality Framework Table already used as a model that my team may use to evaluate a dataset:

- Accuracy -> Correct Values
- Completeness -> Data Fileds with values
- Consistency -> Values free from contradictions
- Currency -> Values up to date
- Relevancy -> Data Items with Value Meta-Data
- Validity -> Data containing allowable values
- Uniqueness -> Values that are duplicated
