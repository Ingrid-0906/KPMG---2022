Data Quality Analysis of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. Datasets

Hey,

I have concluded the analysis on data from Sprocket Central and the four datasets pointed some strutucture or human issues that must be fixed.
The most important aspect was the fact that some fileds like 'product_first_sold_date' in Transactions dataset is in wrong type data and in New Customer List, 4 columns do not have name even the type data is correct, I could not identify what was it about.
Some fields in both datasets are empty and some had been inputed wrongly.
In general, the data is not so good to analysis as it is and the issues are clearly due human mistakes which can be mitigated by a regular cleaning method and check-ups data healthy.

I have attached the code in python.
Any prob, call me back.

Cheers!
Ingrid Cadu
